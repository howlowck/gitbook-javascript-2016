# Store

The `store` ties the concept of `actions`, `state`, and `reducer` together.

There is only one `store` in a redux app.

## creating a `store`
To create a store, get the `createStore` function from the `redux` package.
the `createStore` function takes in the `initialState` and the `reducer` function.

## Methods
There are two methods in the store that we need to be aware of right now:
### `getState()`


### `dispatch(action)`
