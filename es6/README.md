# Introduction

ES6 introduces many convenience functionalities (like object shorthand and de-structuring ) that makes development a lot faster, as well as many new interesting paradigms (like import/export, promises, and generators) that might be foreign to javascript developers.

There are A TON of new features.  **I will only highlight the ones that are used extensively by React and Redux.**
